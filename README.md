# Image Effects

A single-page app allowing users to quickly apply effects to images through their
web browser. Users simply drop images onto their browser, apply effects to them,
and save them.

Built solely using browser-based web components for a simple approach that ignores
the complexity and memory footprint of a full library/framework.
